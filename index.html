        <h1>CSCE 242: Client-Server Computing</h1>
        <h2>Braxton Garner-Robinson</h2>
        <p>Client-Server Computing will address the different ways that the server receives requests,
            and then shares the resources with clients. For example, on a webpage, a user (client) types in a
            url into to a web browser to receive information, this is known as a request. The webpage (server) then 
            sends and displays the requested information to the client's web browser. </p>
