                    <p>The 2011 finals is widely considered as one of LeBron's biggest blemishes on his NBA resume. 
                        During this 7 game series, LeBron and the Miami Heat faced Dirk Nowitzki and the Dallas Mavericks. 
                        The Miami Heat at this point were known as one of the greatest teams ever assembled 
                        and the first "Big 3", including stars like Dwayne Wade and Chris Bosh, while the Dallas Mavericks 
                        had only one star in Dirk Nowitzki. The Mavericks ultimately beat the Miami Heat while LeBron had 
                        some of his worst games in his career, particularly in 4th quarters with the game on the line. 
                        While this was a devastating moment for LeBron, it motivated him so much that he then proceeded to 
                        compete in the NBA finals every year for 8 straight seasons, winning 3 along the way. The table below 
                        details some of the moments that are comprised of the 2011 finals meltdown by LeBron.
