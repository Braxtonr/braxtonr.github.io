                            Freshmen are required to live on campus, but most of our graduate and transfer students are among the 70 percent of students who live off campus. Columbia is an easy-to-navigate city that offers plenty of student-centered housing. Visit Off-Campus Living & Neighborhood Relations to learn more about off-campus housing options, your rights as a tenant or to request legal services.
