        <p>LeBron Raymone James is an American professional basketball player who is one of the 
            greatest of all time and argueably the greatest of all time. His NBA resume 
            includes three NBA championships, four NBA Most Valuable Player Awards, three NBA Finals 
            MVP Awards, and two Olympic gold medals. He was drafted number one overall in 2003, right
            out of high school by his hometown team, the Cleveland Cavaliers. Aside from being an NBA superstar,
            LeBron is also a well known philanthropist. He invests the millions of dollars he makes from his profession
            into his community and uses his platform to speak on different social issues. For example he recently opened a 
            public school he opened in his hometown of Akron, Ohio for under privileged children. The picture above is from the grand opening of the
            I Promise School.</p>
