        <p>LeBron Raymone James is an American professional basketball player who is one of the 
            greatest of all time and is argueably the greatest of all time. He has won 3 NBA championships, 2 
            with the Miami Heat and 1 with the Cleveland Cavaliers. Aside from being an NBA superstar,
            LeBron is also a well known philanthropist. An example is the public school he opened in his 
            hometown of Akron, Ohio for under privileged children.</p>
