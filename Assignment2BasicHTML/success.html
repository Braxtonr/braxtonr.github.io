        <p>In 2016, LeBron James delivered on his promise to bring the first championship to his hometown's team,
            the Cleveland Cavaliers. The promise came after he decided to leave his hometown team in 2010 to join 
            the Miami Heat where he won his first and second championship. Throughout the NBA finals, LeBron averaged 
            nearly a triple double while leading both teams in each statistical category. He also blocked the shot of 
            Andre Igudaoula that helped seal the pivotal game 7. The block is argued as the best block in NBA history 
            and dubbed "The Block". LeBron's team came back from a 3-1 deficit and became the only team in NBA history 
            to do so and win the championship. The table below shows LeBron's stats for the 7 game series.
